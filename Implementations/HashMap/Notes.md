# HashMap implementation
### 1. Integer key value HashMap
* In order to implement this, I will utilize an array of fixed size and 
some node objects. This implementation will serve as a basic version of
the HashMap. After implementing this, I will move on to the universal
key value HashMap which is the basic implementation of a Java HashMap.
### 2. Universal key value HashMap
* Add customizable hashing function.
* Use the template class.
